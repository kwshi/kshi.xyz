# about me

I'm a second-year mathematics PhD student and teaching assistant at UCLA (you might also know me as a junior coach at the U.S. Physics Olympiad team, or an apprentice instructor at [MathILy][mathily]).

[mathily]: https://mathily.org

Besides math, I enjoy other nerdy things like web development, competitive programming, functional programming, and Linux desktop “ricing”. And besides that, I'm also into less-nerdy things like swing and ballroom dancing, cooking, pool, jazz drumming, wheel-throwing, and table tennis (though that is not to say that I'm necessarily any good at any of these things).
