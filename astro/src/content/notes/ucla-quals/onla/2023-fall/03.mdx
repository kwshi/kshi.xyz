Let $A∈ℝ^{n×n}$ with entries $a_{i+1,i}=1$ for $i∈\{1,\dotsc,n-1\}$, $a_{1,n}
   =1$, and all other entries $0$. Let $b$ have entries $b₁=1$ and $bᵢ=0$ for
   $i∈\{2,\dotsc,n\}$. Let $x₀$ be the zero vector. Prove that GMRES applied to
   $Ax=b$ with initial guess $x₀$ results in

   1. $‖b-Axₖ‖=1$ for $1≤k≤n-1$, and
   2. takes $n$ steps to find the true solution.
